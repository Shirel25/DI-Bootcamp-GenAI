1. What is the key difference between traditional machine learning and deep learning?
    It is the way features are extracted and learned.
    Deep Learning learns features automatically from raw data while Machine Learning
    requires manual feature engineering.

2. How do artificial neural networks (ANNs) mimic the human brain?
    Artificial Neural Networks mimic the structure and function of the human
    brain by using layers of interconnected "neurons" that transmit and transform
    information. 

3. Why does deep learning perform better on large datasets compared to traditional machine learning?
    Because it can autmatically learn complex patterns and hierarchical features, but it needs lots of data
    to do that effectively. It has millions of parameters to train. It improves as data volume increases. 
    It needs a lot of examples to gneralize well.

4. What are some challenges of deep learning, and how can they be addressed?
    - Need a lot of data 
    - High computational cost 
    - Hard to interpret (why the model made a decision)
    - Overfitting

5. What is feature engineering, and why is it not needed in deep learning?
    It is the art of transforming raw data into meaningful inputs (features) that a machine learning model 
    can understand ==> The human decides what's important and how to represent it. 
        --> human-guided
    Deep learning learns features automatically from raw data, it learns what to look at by itself
        --> data-guided

6. What role do hidden layers play in a deep learning model?
    These layers are the layers between the input and the output. They are called "hidden" cause we don't see their
    output directly. They gradually extract patterns, features and relations in order to predict well at the end. They
    apply weights, biases and activation function, then pass transformed values to the next layer. 

7. In an artificial neural network (ANN), what is the function of an activation function?
    It is a mathematical function applied at each neuron to decide if it should pass information forward. 
    Common ones are reLU (0, +infinity), Sigmoid (0, 1), Softmax
