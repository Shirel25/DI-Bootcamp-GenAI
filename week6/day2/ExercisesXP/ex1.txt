1. Create a table comparing traditional machine learning and deep learning based on the following aspects:

===== Feature Engineering =====
ML: Requires manual feature extraction by experts. 
    Model performance depends heavily on selected features.
DL: Automatically learns relevant features from raw data during training.

===== Data Processing =====
ML: Works best with structured, clean, and preprocessed data (e.g., tables, CSV).
DL: Can handle unstructured data like images, audio, and text with minimal preprocessing.

===== Scalability =====
ML: Limited scalability; performance doesn’t always improve with more data.
DL: Highly scalable; performance improves significantly with large datasets.

===== Pattern Discovery =====
ML: Finds patterns only within the scope of the provided features.
DL: Learns deep, hierarchical patterns directly from data through multiple layers.

===== Computational Requirements =====
ML: Moderate; can run on standard CPUs.
DL: High; requires GPUs or TPUs for efficient training and inference.



==========================================================================================================================================

2. Identify one real-world problem where traditional ML is better suited and one where deep learning is the superior choice.

===== Traditional Machine Learning is better for: =====
Problem: Predicting customer churn for a small company
Why:
- The dataset is small (maybe a few hundred or thousand examples)
- The data is structured (tables with columns like age, subscription length, usage, etc.)
- Models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost perform well
- Training is fast and interpretable


===== Deep Learning is better for: =====
Problem: Voice recognition for a smart assistant (like Siri or Google Assistant)
Why:
- Huge amounts of unstructured audio data
- Deep models (like RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers) can learn complex temporal patterns
- Scalability and data-hungriness are a strength, not a weakness
- Traditional ML can’t handle the raw audio directly — you’d need heavy feature engineering



==========================================================================================================================================

3. Write a short paragraph (3-5 sentences) explaining why deep learning has an advantage in unstructured data processing.

Deep learning has a major advantage when working with unstructured data like images, text, or audio.
Unlike traditional machine learning, which requires structured and manually engineered features, deep learning can automatically 
learn useful patterns directly from raw data.
Even when the data is messy or not clearly organized, neural networks can extract meaningful representations and make accurate predictions.
This makes deep learning especially powerful in real-world applications where clean, structured datasets are rare.
